# Summary-Writing
As part of a module on Principles of Professional and Technical Communication and Information Design, I wrote descriptive and informative summaries of an article about Wal-Mart and anti-trust law in the USA.

With no prior knowledge of the topic, these summaries demonstrate my ability to turn complex ideas into clear, accessible content. This repository contains the original source text and my summaries.
